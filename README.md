Hi Folks,

We are looking for some people interested in testing our new blank starter theme for Wordpress - called Blank.ly.

You can find the repo here:
https://github.com/locii/tpl-blankly-wp-feb16

Which contains an akeeba file and kickstart.php file in the akeeba folder.

Blank.ly is built on the soon to be released ZGFv4 universal which is a Joomla and Wordpress cpompatible version of the Zen Grid Framework v4.

My aim is to have Blank.ly (a free theme) and Base4 released this week but we need some people familiar with wordpress to take a run through it.

So if you have the time to take a look we would be most appreciative. If you see any issues with the package please post them on the github issues page.

Thanks Anthony
